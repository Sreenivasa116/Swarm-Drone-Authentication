# Swarm-Drone-Authentication

## Overview
This project presents an authentication mechanism for swarm drones operating in a 5G network using proxy signatures and a leader selection mechanism. Drones play a crucial role in 5G architecture by expanding network coverage and enabling Device-to-Device (D2D) communication. However, traditional 4G security solutions lead to heavy traffic towards network core servers, which degrades 5G network performance.

To overcome this, we propose a lightweight, distributed proxy signature-based authentication mechanism that:
- Reduces traffic overhead toward the 5G core network.
- Ensures secure drone-to-drone authentication without overloading the network.
- Implements a leader election algorithm to enhance communication efficiency.

## Features
- **Proxy Signature-Based Authentication**: Enables secure and lightweight authentication within the drone swarm.
- **Leader Selection Mechanism**: Ensures dynamic leader replacement in case of failures.
- **Privacy-Preserving Authentication**: Drones authenticate without revealing their private keys.
- **5G Integration**: Optimized for low-latency, high-speed communication.
- **Reduced Network Overhead**: Reduces the burden on the 5G core by delegating authentication.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vijayroyal358/Swarm-Drone-Authentication.git
cd Swarm-Drone-Authentication
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Main Simulation
```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

### 1. Run the Drone Simulation
```bash
python main.py
```
This starts the swarm simulation with flocking and shape formation.

### 2. Run Shape Visualization
```bash
python plot_shape.py
```
Generates predefined shape formations for drones.

### 3. Run Trajectory Visualization
```bash
python plot_traj.py
```
Plots drone movement trajectories over time.
